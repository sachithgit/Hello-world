PYTHON

*Expressions

50 + 10 =60 (This total thing is called as expression)

50,10 are called as operands

+, = are called as operators

Operators priority in python defined as PEMDAS

()-Paranthis(P) has highest priority next 

** - Exponential(E) has second priority Example 2**5 =32 

* - Multiplication(M) has third priority

/ -  Divison has 4th priority

A- Addition (A) & subtraction has last priority


Example:

(2+5)-6*(10/2)

First (2+5) will be executed 

next (10/2) wil be executed

then 6*(10/2) will be executed.

7-6*5=-23
